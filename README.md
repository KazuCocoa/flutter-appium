# This repository

This repository is for https://kazucocoa.wordpress.com/2018/02/28/flutterflutter-app-with-appium/ . This is really experimental and showcase.

The experimental means I'd have liked to know if we can handle elements with what kind of resources. For example, `accessibilityIdentifier`(iOS) or `resource_id`(Android).

## Flutter app x Appium

Flutter has no `accessibilityIdentifier`(iOS) and `resource_id`(Android).

app: https://github.com/KazuCocoa/my_flutter_app

```ruby
ruby test.rb
```
